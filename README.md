# DataPort

This repository collects different data and timeseries analysis mini-projects I have performed as a postgrad. For each one of them I compiled a report describing the objectives, specifics, methods and results which can be found in the relative subdirectory.

The topics analysided range from climate to financial data, human and social patterns, corporate and public institution policy-making.
